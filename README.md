# 21 projects

This repository consists of the projects that were done by me in the 21 programming school.

* libft
* get next line


## libft
My first own library. The aim of this project was to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
weâ€™ll be allowed to use in all our other projects. Only the following libc functions were allowed : malloc(3), free(3) and write(2).

## get_next_line
